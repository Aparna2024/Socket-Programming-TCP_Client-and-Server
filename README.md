# Socket-Programming-TCP_Client-and-Server

In this project, there are two files, one is tcp_client.java and one is tcp_server.java. In this program the client will be able to send one message to the server and when the server receives the message, it will capitalize all the letters in that message and send the modified message back to the client. Once the client receieves the modified message the connection on the client side closes but the connection on the server side will still be running.
